## Introduction

The Higher Lower Game is a fun and interactive game that challenges you to compare the number of followers between two Instagram profiles. You'll be presented with two profiles, and you have to guess who has more followers. Can you beat your high score and prove your social media expertise?

## How to Play

1. Run the game by executing the following command in the terminal:

   ```shell

The game will present you with two Instagram profiles (Profile A and Profile B).

Your task is to guess which of the two profiles has more followers.

Type 'A' or 'B' to make your choice.

The game will let you know if your guess is correct, and your score will be updated.

Keep playing to see how many correct guesses you can make!
